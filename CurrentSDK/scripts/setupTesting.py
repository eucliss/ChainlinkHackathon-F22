# First thing I need to do is restart my anvil setup

# Then I need to deploy the coordinator using the 

# make deploy-anvil

# then I need to deploy the assets

# make deploy-assets

# I need to parse that TXT for addresses and set them in .env.addresses

# Then when I run the tests and the python shit it will all be there
